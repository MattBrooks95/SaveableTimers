# SaveableTimers is an application that is used for setting short timers quickly.  
## It is still under development.  

* Example use cases
    * Doing a plank for 2 minutes  
    * Boiling noodles for 8 minutes
    * walking to the laundromat in 30 minutes to move your clothes from the washer to the dryer
    * remembering to call back you friend after 5 minutes

* Functionality
    * The user select what audio file plays when the alarm rings.  
    * The dismiss button for dismissing an alarm is unreasonably huge, and easy to press when you are multi-tasking.
    * The user should be able to quickly create a timer by setting the duration and picking a sound file.
    * Using an on screen keyboard should be avoided, because it is slow and annoying.
    * Entering a name and a description for an alarm is optional.
    * Once alarms have been created, they can be easily re-activated for later use.
    * Created alarms persist even the app has been closed, or the phone has been turned off.

* Tools
    * Android Studio.
    * ROOM relational database extraction library
    * Android Jetpack Views.
    * I have not yet learned how to do two-way data binding, but it could be cool.* 

* Goals
    * I want the app to have a Japanese localization.
    * Create an app that I want to use.
    * Eventually be able to publish it on the Google Play Store.
    * Primarily, learn Android development. This entails:
        Learning Kotlin
        Learning Gradle (or at least be able to use it within Android Studio)
        Learn how to create layouts that are effective even on small screens.
    * I use Windows at my current job, so I want to practice developing in a Linux environment. I prefer Linux anyway.

Thanks
* A few weeks ago I made a post in the /r/androiddev subreddit, and [vcjkd](https://www.reddit.com/user/vcjkd/) gave me a lot of good, helpful advice.
