SaveableTimers is an application that is used for setting short timers quickly.
It is still under development.

Example use cases:
    Doing a plank for 2 minutes
    Boiling noodles for 8 minutes
    walking to the laundromat in 30 minutes to move your clothes from the washer to the dryer
    remembering to call back you friend after 5 minutes

Functionality:
    The user select what audio file plays when the alarm rings.
    The dismiss button for dismissing an alarm is unreasonably huge, and easy to press when you are multi-tasking.
    The user should be able to quickly create a timer by setting the duration and picking a sound file.
        Using an on screen keyboard should be avoided, because it is slow and annoying.
        Entering a name and a description for an alarm is optional.
    Once alarms have been created, they can be easily re-activated for later use.
    Created alarms persist even the app has been closed, or the phone has been turned off.

Tools:
    I am using Android Studio.
    I am using the ROOM relational database extraction library.
    I am using Android Jetpack Views.
    I have not yet learned how to do two-way data binding, but it could be cool.

Goals:
    Create an app that I want to use.
    Eventually be able to publish it on the Google Play Store.
    Primarily, learn Android development. This entails:
        Learning Kotlin
        Learning Gradle (or at least be able to use it within Android Studio)
        Learn how to create layouts that are effective even on small screens.
    I use Windows at my current job, so I want to practice developing in a Linux environment. I prefer Linux anyway.
