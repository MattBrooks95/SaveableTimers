active_timers_screen -> add a "deactivate all" button, with a confirmation window
fragment to display data (especially sound file name, timer name, ring time)
	you will need to store the sound file name maybe? I think the filename saved in the database is the one made dynamically when it is copied to the app directory

also, files that are saved to the app directory should then be selectable again by the user, I'm worried that copying the same sound file to the directory over and over again will waste space

when the alarm rings, it doesn't show up above the lock screen (the screen just stays black)

the timing may be off by about a minute somehow...
