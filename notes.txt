deduplicate the active timer panel and the saved timer panel somehow, if it's not a pain in the ass
active_timers_screen -> add a "deactivate all" button, with a confirmation window
fragment to display data (especially sound file name, timer name, ring time)
	you will need to store the sound file name maybe? I think the filename saved in the database is the one made dynamically when it is copied to the app directory
the timing may be off by about a minute somehow...

you need to add start times and ringing times columns to the active timers table

the alarm is not ringing if the application was closed before it rang
	apparently, since android 10 you NEED to build a notification
	according to stacked overflow posts, you can make auto canceling notification that launches a fullscreen activity
	but, right now it just flashes up on the screen and then goes away
	the alarm receiver is hit but the ringing screen activity is not
	you should probably just build a regular notification to get a feel for it,
	then try to get the full screen intent to work
