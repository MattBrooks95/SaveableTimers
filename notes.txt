deduplicate the active timer panel and the saved timer panel somehow, if it's not a pain in the ass
active_timers_screen -> add a "deactivate all" button, with a confirmation window
fragment to display data (especially sound file name, timer name, ring time)
	you will need to store the sound file name maybe? I think the filename saved in the database is the one made dynamically when it is copied to the app directory
the timing may be off by about a minute somehow...

you need to add start times and ringing times columns to the active timers table
